REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Opinion 
We have audited the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements of International Holdings Company 
P.J.S.C. (‚Äúthe Company‚Äù) and its subsidiaries (together ‚Äúthe Group‚Äù), which comprise the 
consolidated statement of Ô¨Ånancial position as at 31 December 2018, and the consolidated 
statement of proÔ¨Åt or loss, consolidated statement of proÔ¨Åt or loss and other comprehensive 
income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash 
Ô¨Çows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements including 
a summary of signiÔ¨Åcant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements present fairly, in all 
material respects, the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial position of the Group as at 31 December 
2018, and its consolidated Ô¨Ånancial performance and its consolidated cash Ô¨Çows for the 
year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs).
Basis for Opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor‚Äôs Responsibilities 
for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are 
independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board 
for Accountants‚Äô Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) together with 
the other ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the Group‚Äôs consolidated 
Ô¨Ånancial statements in the United Arab Emirates, and we have fulÔ¨Ålled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA code. We believe 
that the audit evidence we have obtained is suÔ¨Écient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most 
signiÔ¨Åcance in our audit of the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements of the current year. These 
matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements 
as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters.Allowance for slow  moving inventories
As disclosed in notes 3.11 and 4.2.2 to 
the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements, 
inventories are required to be carried 
at the lower of cost or net realisable 
value. The nature of the items held and 
ageing of the inventory could result in 
an increased allowance.
An assessment of the net realisable 
value of inventory is carried out 
at each reporting period which is 
dependent upon Management‚Äôs 
estimates which involves signiÔ¨Åcant 
judgements. Accordingly, a change 
in the management‚Äôs estimates can 
have a material impact on the carrying 
value of inventories in the Group‚Äôs 
consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements.
 Our procedures in respect of 
allowance for slow moving items 
included:
 
≈î $IBMMFOHFE UIF SFBTPOBCMFOFTT PG

Application of IFRS 9 Financial 
Instruments
The Group adopted IFRS 9 Financial 
Instruments (‚ÄúIFRS 9‚Äù) with eÔ¨Äect from 
1 January 2018. IFRS 9 supersedes 
the requirements of IAS 39 Financial 
Instruments ‚Äì Recognition and 
Measurement.
 
IFRS 9 addresses the classiÔ¨Åcation, 
measurement and hedge accounting 
for Ô¨Ånancial instruments at amortised 
cost. IFRS 9 introduces new impairment 
model for Ô¨Ånancial assets and contract 
assets. Management has determined 
that the most signiÔ¨Åcant impact of 
the new standard on the Group‚Äôs 
consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements 
relates to the expected credit loss (‚ÄúECL‚Äù) 
for impairment of trade receivables and 
contract assets.
As at 31 December 2018, the carrying 
value of trade receivables and contract 
assets from customers amounted to 
AED 107,293 thousand and AED 36,927 
thousand, respectively (Note 12). 
ECL computed for trade receivables 
and contract assets from customers 
amounted to AED 14,411 thousand and 
AED 7,165, respectively (Note 12).
 
The Group assesses at each reporting 
date whether the Ô¨Ånancial assets carried 
at amortised cost are credit-impaired. 
Management has applied simpliÔ¨Åed 
approach for measurement of ECL 
for trade receivables. The ECL model 
involves use of various assumptions, 
macro-economic factors and study of 
historical trends relating to the Group‚Äôs 
trade collections experience.
 
We consider this a key audit matter 
due to the judgments and estimates 
involved in the application of the 
expected credit loss model.
 
Refer to note 2.1 which explains the 
impact application of IFRS 9, Note 3 
for accounting policy and Note 12 for 
related disclosures in the accompanying 
consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements.We performed the following 
procedures in relation to the 
application of IFRS 9: 
 
≈î3FWJFXFENBOBHFNFOU≈çTBTTFTTNFOU
of the application of IFRS 9 in terms of 
the classiÔ¨Åcation and measurement 
of Ô¨Ånancial assets and liabilities, 
and understood the approach 
taken towards implementation. We 
speciÔ¨Åcally considered the validity of 
management‚Äôs conclusion that the 
main area of impact was in respect of 
impairment of trade receivables and 
other receivables, using our experience 
and knowledge of similar entities;
≈î$PNQBSFEUIF&$-NPEFMEFWFMPQFE
by management to that required by IFRS 
9 and reviewed the reasonableness of 
the methodology in comparison to 
accepted best practice. We also tested 
the arithmetical accuracy of the model;
≈î 5FTUFE LFZ BTTVNQUJPOT TVDI BT
those used to calculate the likelihood 
of default and the subsequent loss on 
default, by comparing to historical data. 
We also considered the incorporation 
of forward looking factors to reÔ¨Çect the 
impact of future events on expected 
credit losses; 
≈î*OWPMWFEPVSJOUFSOBMTVCKFDUNBUUFS
specialist to review the methodology 
used in the ECL model and compared 
this against the accepted practices.
 
We have also assessed the 
appropriateness of the disclosures 
provided in Note 2, Note 3 and Note 
12 to the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial 
statements.How our audit addressed the 
key audit matters.Key audit matters
Revenue recognition on construction 
contracts
 
As disclosed in notes 3.5 and 21 to 
the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements, 
the Group enters into construction 
contracts with customers.  Revenue 
from these contracts is recognised 
over time as performance obligations 
are fulÔ¨Ålled as services are performed.
 
The status of contracts is updated on a 
regular basis. In doing so, management 
is required to exercise signiÔ¨Åcant 
judgement in their assessment of 
the valuation of contract variations,

The potential Ô¨Ånal contract outcomes 
can cover a wide range. Dependent 
on the level of judgement in each, 
the range on each contract can be

changes in these judgements, and the

can result in material adjustments to

be both positive or negative.Our work on the recognition of contract

Other Information 
The Board of Directors and Management are responsible for the other information. The 
other information comprises the Directors‚Äô report and the annual report of the Group. 
We obtained the Directors‚Äô report prior to the date of this auditor‚Äôs report and the 
remaining information of the annual report is expected to be made available to us after 
that date. The other information does not include the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements 
and our auditor‚Äôs report thereon.
Our opinion on the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements does not cover the other 
information and we do not express any form of assurance or conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements, our responsibility 
is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information 
is materially inconsistent with the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior 
to the date of this auditor‚Äôs report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of 
this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in 
this regard. 
When we read the remaining information of the annual report of the Group, if we 
conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate 
the matter to Those Charged with Governance.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the 
consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements  
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated 
Ô¨Ånancial statements in accordance with IFRS and their preparation in compliance with the applicable provisions of the UAE Federal Law No. (2) of 2015, and for such internal 
control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated 
Ô¨Ånancial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error.
In preparing the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements, management is responsible for 
assessing the Group‚Äôs ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
The Audit Committee and Those Charged with Governance are responsible for overseeing 
the Group‚Äôs Ô¨Ånancial reporting process.
Auditor‚Äôs Responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated 
Ô¨Ånancial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor‚Äôs report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to inÔ¨Çuence the economic decisions of users taken on 
the basis of these consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements. 
As part of an audit in accordance with ISA‚Äôs, we exercise professional judgement and 
maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive 
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is suÔ¨Écient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than the one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omission, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

exists related to events or conditions that may cast signiÔ¨Åcant doubt on the Group‚Äôs 
ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our auditor‚Äôs report to the related disclosures in the 
consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our 
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our Annual Report 2018 Annual Report 2018

Ô¨Ånancial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of 
the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with Those Charged with Governance regarding, among other matters, 
the planned scope and timing of the audit and signiÔ¨Åcant audit Ô¨Åndings, including any 
signiÔ¨Åcant deÔ¨Åciencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide Those Charged with Governance with a statement that we have complied 
with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with 
them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with Those Charged with Governance, we determine 
those matters that were of most signiÔ¨Åcance in the audit of the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial 
statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these 
matters in our auditor‚Äôs report unless law and regulations preclude public disclosure about 
the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should 
not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest beneÔ¨Åts of such communication.

2   Application of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)
2.1   New and revised IFRSs eÔ¨Äective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 
January 2018
The following new and revised IFRSs, which became eÔ¨Äective for annual periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2018, have been adopted in these consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements.
The Group applies, for the Ô¨Årst time, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (as revised in July 2014) and 
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers and the related consequential amendments to 
other IFRS Standards that are eÔ¨Äective for annual period that begins on or after 1 January 2018. 
The impact of the initial application of these standards is disclosed as below.
In the current year, the Group has also applied a number of amendments to IFRS Standards and 
Interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that are eÔ¨Äective 
for an annual period that begins on or after 1 January 2018 as below:

or on the amounts reported in these consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements.
Impact of initial application of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
In the current year, the Group has applied IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (as revised in July 2014) 
and the related consequential amendments to other IFRS Standards that are mandatorily eÔ¨Äective 
for an accounting period that begins on or after 1 January 2018. Transition provisions of IFRS 9 
allow an entity not to restate comparatives.  
Additionally, the Group adopted consequential amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: 
Disclosures that were applied to the disclosures about 2018.
Impact of initial application of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
Details of these IFRS 9 new requirements as well as their impact on the Group‚Äôs Ô¨Ånancial 
statements are described below.
a. ClassiÔ¨Åcation and measurement
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 9 to instruments that have not been 
derecognised as at 1/uni00A0January 2018 and has not applied the requirements to instruments that have 
already been derecognised as at 1 January 2018.
All recognised Ô¨Ånancial assets that are within the scope of IFRS 9 are required to be measured 
subsequently at amortised cost or fair value on the basis of the Group‚Äôs business model for 
managing the Ô¨Ånancial assets and the contractual cash Ô¨Çow characteristics of the Ô¨Ånancial assets.
The management of the Group reviewed and assessed the Group‚Äôs existing Ô¨Ånancial assets as at 1 
January 2018 based on the facts and circumstances that existed at that date and concluded that 
the initial application of IFRS 9 has had the following impact on the Group‚Äôs Ô¨Ånancial assets as 
regards their classiÔ¨Åcation and measurement:
≈îUIF(SPVQ≈çTJOWFTUNFOUTJOFRVJUZJOTUSVNFOUT	OFJUIFSIFMEGPSUSBEJOHOPSBDPOUJOHFOU
consideration arising from a business combination) that were previously classiÔ¨Åed as available-
for-sale Ô¨Ånancial assets under IAS 39 have been designated as at FVTOCI. The change in fair 
value on these equity instruments are accumulated in the investment revaluation reserve;

amortised cost continue to be measured at amortised cost under IFRS 9 as they are held within a 
business model to collect contractual cash Ô¨Çows and these cash Ô¨Çows consist solely of payments 
of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
b Impairment of Ô¨Ånancial assets
In relation to the impairment of Ô¨Ånancial assets, IFRS 9 requires an expected credit loss model as 
opposed to an incurred credit loss model under IAS 39. The expected credit loss model requires 
the Group to account for expected credit losses and changes in those expected credit losses at 
each reporting date to reÔ¨Çect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the Ô¨Ånancial assets. Notes to the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements for the year ended 31

(continued)
2.1 New and revised IFRSs eÔ¨Äective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 
January 2018  (continued)
Impact of initial application of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
In other words, it is no longer necessary for a credit event to have occurred before credit losses 
are recognised.
SpeciÔ¨Åcally, IFRS 9 requires the Group to recognise a loss allowance for expected credit losses 
on due from related parties (Note 11), trade and other receivables  (Note 12) and cash and bank 
balances (Note 13).  
In particular, IFRS 9 requires the Group to measure the loss allowance for a Ô¨Ånancial instrument 
at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses (ECL) if the credit risk on that Ô¨Ånancial 
instrument has increased signiÔ¨Åcantly since initial recognition, or if the Ô¨Ånancial instrument is a 
purchased or originated creditimpaired Ô¨Ånancial asset.
b. Impairment of Ô¨Ånancial assets (continued)
However, if the credit risk on a Ô¨Ånancial instrument has not increased signiÔ¨Åcantly since initial 
recognition (except for a purchased or originated creditimpaired Ô¨Ånancial asset), the Group 
is required to measure the loss allowance for that Ô¨Ånancial instrument at an amount equal to 
12months ECL. IFRS 9 also requires a simpliÔ¨Åed approach for measuring the loss allowance at 
an amount equal to lifetime ECL for trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables in 
certain circumstances.
Because the Group has elected not to restate comparatives, for the purpose of assessing whether 
there has been a signiÔ¨Åcant increase in credit risk since initial recognition of Ô¨Ånancial instruments 
that remain recognised on the date of initial application of IFRS 9 (i.e. 1 January 2018), the 
management has compared the credit risk of the respective Ô¨Ånancial instruments on the date of 
their initial recognition to their credit risk as at 1 January 2018.
c. ClassiÔ¨Åcation and measurement of Ô¨Ånancial liabilities
The application of IFRS 9 has had no material impact on the classiÔ¨Åcation and measurement of 
the Group‚Äôs Ô¨Ånancial liabilities.

Amendments to IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
In the current year, the Group has applied IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (as 
amended in April 2016) which is mandatorily eÔ¨Äective for an accounting period that begins on 
or after 1 January 2018. Details of the new requirements as well as their impact on the Group‚Äôs 
Ô¨Ånancial statements are described below.
Under IFRS 15, an entity recognises when (or as) a performance obligation is satisÔ¨Åed, i.e. when 
‚Äòcontrol‚Äô of the goods or services underlying the particular performance obligation is transferred 
to the customer. Far more prescriptive guidance has been added in IFRS 15 to deal with speciÔ¨Åc 
scenarios. Furthermore, extensive disclosures are required by IFRS 15.
IFRS 15 uses the terms ‚Äòcontract asset‚Äô and ‚Äòcontract liability‚Äô to describe what might more 
commonly be known as ‚Äòaccrued revenue‚Äô and ‚Äòdeferred revenue‚Äô , however the Standard does 
not prohibit an entity from using alternative descriptions in the statement of Ô¨Ånancial position. 
The Group has adopted the terminology used in IFRS 15 to describe such balances.
The application of the amendments in IFRS 15 had no impact on the Ô¨Ånancial position and/or 
Ô¨Ånancial performance of the Group.
2.2 New and revised IFRS in issue but not yet eÔ¨Äective 
The Group has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been issued but are not 
yet eÔ¨Äective.
New and revised IFRSsEÔ¨Äective for annual 
periods 
beginning on or after
IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019
General impact of application of IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 provides a comprehensive model for the identiÔ¨Åcation of 
lease arrangements and their treatment in the Ô¨Ånancial statements 
for both lessors and lessees. IFRS 16 will supersede the current lease 
guidance including IAS 17 Leases and the related Interpretations 
when it becomes eÔ¨Äective for accounting periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2019.
The Group will make use of the practical expedient available on 
transition to IFRS 16 not to reassess whether the existing contracts 
contains lease. Accordingly, the deÔ¨Ånition of a lease in accordance 
with IAS 17 and  IFRIC 4 will continue to apply to those leases 
entered or modiÔ¨Åed before 1 January 2019
The Group will apply the deÔ¨Ånition of a lease and related guidance 
set out in IFRS 16 to all lease contracts entered into or modiÔ¨Åed on 
or after 1January  2019 (whether it is a lessor or a lessee in the lease 
contract).Notes to the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements for the year ended 31

Impact on Lessee Accounting1 January 2019
Operating leases
IFRS 16 will change how the Group accounts for leases previously classi-
Ô¨Åed as operating leases under IAS 17, as oÔ¨Ä -balance sheet items.
On initial application of IFRS 16, for all leases the Group will:
a. Recognise right-of -use assets and lease liabilities in the consolidated 
statement of Ô¨Ånancial position;
b.  Estimate the incremental borrowing rate and use it to determine the
present value of the future lease payments; 
c.  Recognise depreciation of right-of -use assets and interest on lease
liabilities in the consolidated statement of proÔ¨Åt or loss; and
d.  Separate the total amount of cash paid into a principal portion
(presented within Ô¨Ånancing activities) and interest expense (presented
within operating activities) in the statement of cash Ô¨Çow.
For short-term leases and leases of low-value assets, the Group will opt 
to recognise a lease expense on a straight-line basis as permitted by IFRS 
16.
The Group plans to apply modiÔ¨Åed retrospective approach upon adop-
tion of IFRS 16. 
Management has carried out an initial assessment of the impact of IFRS 
16 based on certain practical expedients for certain leasing arrange-
ments as of 31 December 2018 which are expected to continue as at 
1 January 2019. It is anticipated that the Group will need to recognise 
right-of-use assets of AED 14,084 thousand and obligation under Ô¨Å-
nance lease of AED 13,808 thousand. The resulting diÔ¨Äerence of AED 
276 thousand will be directly adjusted against opening retained earnings 
at the initial application date.
The impact analysis above is provisional and may be subject to adjust-
ments once management completes its review.

Management anticipates that these new standards, interpretations and amendments will be 
adopted in the Group‚Äôs Ô¨Ånancial statements as and when they are applicable and adoption of 
these new standards, interpretations and amendments, except for IFRS 16 as highlighted in 
previous paragraphs, may have no material impact on the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements of 
the Group in the period of initial application.
3  SigniÔ¨Åcant accounting policies
3.1 Statement of compliance
The consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements have been prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and applicable requirements of the UAE Federal Law No. (2) 
of 2015 and the Company‚Äôs articles of association.
3.2 Basis of preparation
The consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for 
biological assets and Ô¨Ånancial instruments that are measured at fair value or amortised cost as 
explained in the accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of 
the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. Notes to the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements for the year ended 31 
December 2018 (continued)
3 SigniÔ¨Åcant accounting policies (continued)
3.2 Basis of preparation (continued)
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether 
that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the 
fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset 
or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the 
asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes 
in these consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements is determined on such basis, except for share-based 
payment transactions that are within the scope of IFRS 2, leasing transactions that are within the 
scope of IAS 17, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, 
such as net realisable value in IAS 2 or value in use in IAS 36.
In addition, for Ô¨Ånancial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 
1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable 
and the signiÔ¨Åcance of the inputs to the fair value measurements in its entirety, which are 
described as follows:

with a distinction based on expectations regarding recovery or settlement within twelve months 
after the reporting date (current) and more than twelve months after the reporting date (non-
current), presented in the notes.
The amounts in the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements are rounded to nearest thousand 
(‚ÄúAED‚Äô000‚Äù) except when otherwise indicated.

including voting patterns at previous shareholders‚Äô meetings.
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and 
ceases when the Company loses control of the subsidiary. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, income and expenses 
of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income 
statement and consolidated statement of other comprehensive income from the date the 
Company gains control until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary.
ProÔ¨Åt or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners 
of the Company and to the non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries 
is attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests even if this 
results in the non-controlling interests having a deÔ¨Åcit balance.
When necessary, adjustments are made to the Ô¨Ånancial statements of subsidiaries to bring 
their accounting policies in line with the Group‚Äôs accounting policies. All intragroup assets and 
liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash Ô¨Çows relating to transactions between members of 
the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.
Changes in the Group‚Äôs ownership interests in existing subsidiaries:
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, a gain or loss is recognised in proÔ¨Åt or loss and 
is calculated as the diÔ¨Äerence between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration 
received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the 
assets and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. All amounts previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary are accounted for as if 
the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities of the subsidiary (i.e. reclassiÔ¨Åed 
to proÔ¨Åt or loss or transferred to another category of equity as speciÔ¨Åed/ permitted by applicable 
IFRSs). The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control 
is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under IFRS 
9, when applicable, the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or a joint 
venture.Notes to the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements for the year ended 31

In 2017, Alliance Food Security Holdings USA was incorporated as a fully owned subsidiary of the 
Group. This subsidiary is non-operating as of 31 December 2018.  
During the current year, the Alliance Food Security Holdings acquired 100% interest in a new 
subsidiary ‚ÄúForrajes San Mateo, S.L.U‚Äù for a total consideration of EUR 1,065,000 (AED/uni00A04,830,222). 
Out of the total consideration, the Group has paid EUR 800,000 (AED/uni00A03,648,000) and the 
balance consideration of EUR/uni00A0265,000 (AED/uni00A01,182,222) is payable in 2019.  The Group appointed 
an independent valuer for the purchase price allocation related to the acquisition.  The fair 
value of identiÔ¨Åable net assets was AED/uni00A07,319,536 and the Group recognised gain on acquisition 
amounting to AED/uni00A02,489,313.
During the current year, the Group disposed of 30% of its interest in Alliance Food Security 
Holdings LLC, reducing its controlling interest to 70% for a consideration amounting to 
AED/uni00A05,869,967.  An amount of AED/uni00A05,824,942 (being the proportionate share of the carrying 
amount of the net assets of the subsidiary) has been transferred to non-controlling interest.  
The diÔ¨Äerence of AED/uni00A045,025 between the increase in the non-controlling interest and the 
consideration received has been credited to retained earnings.
During the current year, Asmak Holding Company Limited was incorporated as a wholly owned 
subsidiary of the Group. This subsidiary is non-operating as of 31 December 2018.
3.4 Business combinations
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration 
transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum 
of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by 
the Group to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group in 
exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are generally recognised in proÔ¨Åt 
or loss as incurred.
At the acquisition date, the identiÔ¨Åable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised 
at their fair value.Notes to the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements for the year ended 31 
December 2018 (continued)
3 SigniÔ¨Åcant accounting policies (continued)
3.4 Business combinations (continued)
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount 
of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer‚Äôs previously 
held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the 
identiÔ¨Åable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If, after reassessment, the net of the 
acquisition-date amounts of the identiÔ¨Åable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the 
sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree 
and the fair value of the acquirer‚Äôs previously held interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is 
recognised immediately in proÔ¨Åt or loss as a bargain purchase gain. 
Non-controlling interests that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a 
proportionate share of the entity‚Äôs net assets in the event of liquidation may be initially measured 
either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests‚Äô proportionate share of the recognised 
amounts of the acquiree‚Äôs identiÔ¨Åable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on 
a transaction-by-transaction basis. Other types of non-controlling interests are measured at fair 
value or, when applicable, on the basis speciÔ¨Åed in another IFRS.
When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination includes assets or 
liabilities resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is 
measured at its acquisition-date fair value and included as part of the consideration transferred in 
a business combination. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as 
measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments 
against goodwill. Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional 
information obtained during the ‚Äòmeasurement period‚Äô (which cannot exceed one year from the 
acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.
The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that do 
not qualify as measurement period adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration 
is classiÔ¨Åed. Contingent consideration that is classiÔ¨Åed as equity is not measured at subsequent 
reporting dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent 
consideration that is classiÔ¨Åed as an asset or a liability is remeasured at subsequent reporting 
dates in accordance with IFRS 9 or IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent 
Assets, as appropriate, with the corresponding gain or loss being recognised in proÔ¨Åt or loss.
When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group‚Äôs previously held equity interest 
in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date when the Group 
obtains control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in proÔ¨Åt or loss. Amounts 
arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been 
recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassiÔ¨Åed to proÔ¨Åt or loss where such 
treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting 
period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items 
for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the 
measurement period (see above), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reÔ¨Çect new 
information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date that, if 
known, would have aÔ¨Äected the amounts recognised at that date.Annual Report 2018 Annual Report 2018

3.5 Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at an amount that reÔ¨Çects the considerations, to which an entity expects 
to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to customer, excluding amounts 
collected on behalf of third parties. Revenue is reduced for estimated customer returns, rebates, 
discounts and other similar allowances. Revenue is recognised only when the Group has 
transferred control over goods or services to its customers.
The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the observable price at which the Group 
sells the products and services on a standalone basis.
3.5.1 Upon adoption of IFRS 15 ‚Äì applicable from 1 January 2018
3.5.1.1  Sale of goods
The Group sells Ô¨Åsh and Ô¨Åsh products to customers.  Revenue from sale of goods is recognised 
when control of the goods has transferred, being when the goods have been shipped to the 
customer.  Following delivery, the customer has full discretion over the manner of distribution 
and price to sell the goods, has the primary responsibility when on selling the goods and bears 
the risks of obsolescence and loss in relation to the goods.
A receivable is recognised by the Group when the goods are delivered to the customer as this 
represents the point in time at which the right to consideration becomes unconditional, as only 
the passage of time is required before payment is due.
3.5.1.2  Construction contracts
The Group provides construction with services with customers.  Such contracts are entered into 
before rendering of services begins.  Under the terms of the contracts, the Group is contractually 
restricted from reducing the structure under construction to another customer and has 
enforceable right to payment for work done.  Revenue from construction is therefore recognised 
over time on a cost to cost method based the proportion of contract costs incurred for work 
performed to date relative to the estimated total contract costs.  The management consider that 
this input method is an appropriate measure of the progress towards complete satisfaction of the 
performance obligations under IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is 
measured based on the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in a contract 
with a customer and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Contract costs are 
recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. When it is possible that total 
contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense 
immediately.
Costs of contracts include all direct costs of labour, materials, depreciation of property and 
equipment and costs of subcontracted works, plus an appropriate portion of construction 
overheads and general and administrative expenses of the year allocated to construction 
contracts in progress during the year at a Ô¨Åxed rate of the value of work done on each contract.  
Any under recovery at the end of the Ô¨Åscal year, is charged to proÔ¨Åt or loss as unallocated 
overheads.
The gross amount of contract assets from customers classiÔ¨Åed under trade and other 
receivables, is the net amount of costs incurred plus recognised proÔ¨Åts; less recognised losses 
and progress billings, for all contracts in progress for which costs incurred plus recognised proÔ¨Åts 
(less recognised losses) exceeds progress billings.Notes to the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements for the year ended 31

3.5 Revenue recognition (continued)
3.5.1.2 Construction contracts (continued)
The gross amount contract liabilities to customers classiÔ¨Åed under accounts payable, is the net 
amount of costs incurred plus recognised proÔ¨Åts less recognised losses and less progress billings, 
for all contracts in progress for which progress billings exceed costs incurred plus recognised 
proÔ¨Åts (less recognised losses).
The eÔ¨Äect of a change in the estimates of contract revenue or contract costs or the outcome of a 
contract, including that arising from liquidated damages and Ô¨Ånal contract settlements, is used in 
the determination of the amount of revenue and costs recognised in proÔ¨Åt or loss in the period in 
which the change is made and in subsequent periods.
3.5.1.3  Rental income
The Group enters into operating leases for its investment property. Rental income from such 
operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial 
direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying 
amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
3.5.1.4 Services 
Revenue relating to services is recognised over time.  The transaction price is straight lined over 
the period of service. 
3.5.1.5  Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised in proÔ¨Åt or loss when the Group‚Äôs right to receive the dividends is 
established.
3.5.1.6 Interest income
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the 
eÔ¨Äective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash 
receipts through the expected life of the Ô¨Ånancial asset to the asset‚Äôs net carrying amount.
3.5.2 Revenue recognition under IAS 18 - applicable before 1 January 2018
3.5.2.1 Sale of goods

3.5.2.2 Construction contracts
Where the outcome of a construction/maintenance contract can be estimated reliably, revenue 
and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at 
the end of the reporting period, measured based on the proportion of contract costs included 
for work performed to date relative to the estimated total contract costs, except where this 
would not be representative of the stage of completion. Variations in contract work, claims and 
incentive payments are included to the extent that the amount can be measured reliably and its 
receipt is considered probable.
Where the outcome of a construction/maintenance contract cannot be estimated reliably, 
contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred that it is probable will be 
recoverable. Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
When it is possible that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss 
is recognised as an expense immediately.
Costs of contracts include all direct costs of labour, materials, depreciation of property and 
equipment and costs of subcontracted works, plus an appropriate portion of construction 
overheads allocated to construction contracts in progress during the year at a Ô¨Åxed rate of the 
value of work done on each contract.  Any under recovery at the end of the Ô¨Åscal year, is charged 
to proÔ¨Åt or loss as unallocated overheads.
When contract costs incurred to date plus recognised proÔ¨Åts less recognised losses exceed 
progress billings, the surplus is shown as amounts due from customers for contract work. For 
contracts where progress billings exceed contract costs incurred to date plus recognised proÔ¨Åts 
less recognised losses, the surplus is shown as the amounts due to customers for contract 
work. Amounts received before the related work is performed are included in the consolidated 
statement of Ô¨Ånancial position, as a liability, as advances received. Amounts billed for work 
performed but not yet paid by the customer are included in the consolidated statement of 
Ô¨Ånancial position under trade and other receivables.
The eÔ¨Äect of a change in the estimates of contract revenue or contract costs or the outcome of a 
contract, including that arising from liquidated damages and Ô¨Ånal contract settlements, is used in 
the determination of the amount of revenue and costs recognised in proÔ¨Åt or loss in the period in 
which the change is made and in subsequent periods.
3.5.2.3 Rental income
The Group enters into operating leases for its investment property. Rental income from such 
operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial 
direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying 
amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.Notes to the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements for the year ended 31

3.5.2.4 Services 
Revenue from services is accrued and recognised as the services are rendered. Revenue is 
recognised only when it is probable that the economic beneÔ¨Åts associated with the transaction 
will Ô¨Çow to the Group. 
3.5.2.5 Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised in proÔ¨Åt or loss when the Group‚Äôs right to receive the dividends is 
established.
3.5.2.6 Interest income
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the 
eÔ¨Äective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash 
receipts through the expected life of the Ô¨Ånancial asset to the asset‚Äôs net carrying amount.
3.6 Leasing
Leases are classiÔ¨Åed as Ô¨Ånance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classiÔ¨Åed as operating 
leases.
3.6.1 The Group as lessor
 Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
relevant lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are 
added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term.
3.6.2 The Group as lessee
Assets held under Ô¨Ånance leases are initially recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at 
the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The 
corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the consolidated statement of Ô¨Ånancial position 
as a Ô¨Ånance lease liability.
Lease payments are apportioned between Ô¨Ånance expenses and reduction of the lease obligation 
so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance 
expenses are recognised immediately in proÔ¨Åt or loss, unless they are directly attributable to 
qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Group‚Äôs general 
policy on borrowing costs.
Leases payable under operating leases are charged to proÔ¨Åt or loss on a straight-line basis over 
the term of the relevant lease. BeneÔ¨Åts received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an 
operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Annual Report 2018 Annual Report 2018

3.7 Foreign currencies
The individual Ô¨Ånancial statements of each group entity are presented in the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates (its functional currency). For the 
purpose of the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements, the results and Ô¨Ånancial position of each group 
entity are expressed in United Arab Emirates Dirhams (‚ÄúAED‚Äù), which is the functional currency of 
the Group and the presentation currency for the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements.
In preparing the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements of the Group, transactions in currencies other 
than the Group‚Äôs functional currency (foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange 
prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At each reporting date, monetary items denominated 
in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the reporting date. Non-monetary 
items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the 
rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are 
measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange diÔ¨Äerences are recognised in proÔ¨Åt or loss in the period in which they arise except for 
foreign operations.
3.8 Property, plant and equipment
Capital work in progress is stated at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Depreciation of 
these assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready 
for their intended use.
Other property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
accumulated impairment loss. 
Subsequent costs are included in the asset‚Äôs carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, 
as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic beneÔ¨Åts associated with the item 
will Ô¨Çow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and 
maintenance expenses are charged to the proÔ¨Åt or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation is charged so as to write oÔ¨Ä the cost of assets, other than capital work in progress, 
over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives, 
residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at each year end, with the eÔ¨Äect of any 
changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment 
is determined as the diÔ¨Äerence between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset 
and is recognised in the proÔ¨Åt or loss.
The useful lives considered in the calculation of depreciation for the assets are as follows:
Years
Fish farming assets 5 - 12
Buildings and leasehold improvements 5 - 33
Plant and equipment 3 - 5
Furniture, Ô¨Åxtures and oÔ¨Éce equipment 3 - 5
Motor vehicles 4 - 5
Marine vessels 10 - 25Notes to the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements for the year ended 31

3.9 Investment properties 
Investment properties are properties held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation. 
Investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation at the reporting date. 
Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method based on the anticipated useful life or term 
of the lease whichever is earlier.
Investment property is derecognised upon disposal or when the investment property is 
permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic beneÔ¨Åts are expected. Any gain or loss 
arising on derecognition of the property (calculated as the diÔ¨Äerence between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in proÔ¨Åt or loss in the period in which 
the property is derecognised.
Depreciation is charged so as to write oÔ¨Ä the cost of a property over its estimated useful life of 8 
years, using straight-line method. 
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at each year 
end, with the eÔ¨Äect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.
3.10 Investment in associates and joint ventures
An associate is an entity over which the Group has signiÔ¨Åcant inÔ¨Çuence. SigniÔ¨Åcant inÔ¨Çuence is 
the power to participate in the Ô¨Ånancial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not 
control or joint control over those policies.
A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the 
arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint arrangement. Joint control is the 
contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions 
about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates and joint ventures are incorporated in these 
consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity 
method, an investment in associates and joint ventures is initially recognised in the consolidated 
statement of Ô¨Ånancial position at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group‚Äôs share of 
the proÔ¨Åt or loss and other comprehensive income of the associates and joint ventures. When 
the Group‚Äôs share of losses of associates and joint ventures exceeds the Group‚Äôs interest in that 
associates and joint ventures (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form 
part of the Group‚Äôs net investment in the associates and joint ventures), the Group discontinues 
recognising its share of further losses. Additional losses are recognised only to the extent that 
the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the 
associates and joint ventures.
An investment in an associate or a joint venture is accounted for using the equity method from 
the date on which the investee becomes an associate or joint venture. On acquisition of the 
investment in an associate or a joint venture, any excess of the cost of acquisition over the 
Group‚Äôs share of the net fair value of the identiÔ¨Åable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
of associates and joint ventures recognised at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill, 
which is included within the carrying amount of the investment. Any excess of the Group‚Äôs share 
of the net fair value of the identiÔ¨Åable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of 
acquisition, after reassessment, is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement 
in the period in which the investment is acquired.Annual Report 2018 Annual Report 2018
Notes to the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements for the year ended 31 
December 2018 (continued)
3 SigniÔ¨Åcant accounting policies (continued)
3.10 Investment associates and joint ventures (continued)
The requirements of IAS 36 are applied to determine whether it is necessary to recognise any 
impairment loss with respect to the Group‚Äôs investment in associates and joint ventures. When 
necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for 
impairment in accordance with IAS 36 ‚ÄúImpairment of Assets‚Äù as a single asset by comparing 
its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell) with its carrying 
amount. Any impairment loss recognised forms part of the carrying amount of the investment. 
Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognised in accordance with IAS 36 to the extent that 
the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases.
The Group discontinues the use of equity method from the date when the investment ceases 
to be an associate or a joint venture. When the Group retains its interest in the former associate 
or joint venture and the retained interest is a Ô¨Ånancial asset, the Group measures the retained 
interest at fair value at that date and the fair value is regarded as its fair value on initial recognition 
in accordance with IFRS 9. The diÔ¨Äerence between the carrying amount of the associate or 
joint venture at the date the equity method was discontinued, and the fair value of any retained 
interest and any proceeds from disposing of a part interest in the associate or joint venture is 
included in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal of the associate or joint venture.
In addition, the Group accounts for all amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income by that associate or joint venture would be reclassiÔ¨Åed to proÔ¨Åt or loss on the disposal 
of the related assets or liabilities. Therefore, if a gain or loss previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income by that associate or joint venture would be reclassiÔ¨Åed to proÔ¨Åt or loss on 
the disposal of the related assets or liabilities, the Group reclassiÔ¨Åes the gain or loss from equity to 
proÔ¨Åt or loss (as a reclassiÔ¨Åcation adjustment) when the equity method is discontinued.
The Group continues to use the equity method when an investment in an associate becomes 
an investment in a joint venture or an investment in joint venture becomes an investment in an 
associate. There is no remeasurement to fair value upon such changes in ownership interests.
When the Group reduces its ownership interest in an associate or a joint venture but the Group 
continues to use the equity method, the Group reclassiÔ¨Åes to proÔ¨Åt or loss the proportion of the 
gain or loss that had previously been recognised in other comprehensive income relating to that 
reduction in ownership interest if that gain or loss would be/uni00A0reclassiÔ¨Åed to proÔ¨Åt or loss on the 
disposal of the related assets or liabilities. 
When a Group‚Äôs entity transacts with an associate or a joint venture of the Group, proÔ¨Åts and 
losses resulting from the transactions with the associate or joint ventures are recognised in the 
Group‚Äôs consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements only to the extent of interests in the associates or joint 
venture that are not related to the Group.Notes to the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements for the year ended 31

3.11 Inventories
3.11.1 Fish and Ô¨Åsh products
Fish and Ô¨Åsh products are stated at lower of cost or net realisable value, cost is determined using 
the Ô¨Årst-in, Ô¨Årst-out (FIFO) basis. Cost includes purchase cost, freight, insurance and other related 
expenses incurred in bringing the goods to their present condition and location. Net realisable 
value is based on the normal selling price, less cost expected to be incurred in marketing, selling 
and distribution. Allowance is made when necessary for obsolete, slow-moving and damaged 
items.
3.11.2 Packing and raw materials
Packing and raw materials are stated at the lower of weighted average cost and net realisable 
value. Cost includes all costs incurred in bringing inventory to its present condition and location. 
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs to be incurred 
in marketing, selling and distribution.
3.12 Biological assets
Biological assets are measured on initial recognition and at end of each reporting period at fair 
value less estimated costs to sell. The fair values are determined based on current market prices 
of similar type of assets. Costs to sell include commission to brokers and dealers. 
A gain or loss on initial recognition of biological assets at fair value less estimated costs to sell 
and from a change in fair value less estimated costs to sell of biological assets shall be included in 
proÔ¨Åt or loss in the period in which it arises.
3.13 Impairment of tangible assets
At the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its assets 
whether there is any indication that those assets have suÔ¨Äered an impairment loss. If any such 
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the 
extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount 
of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to 
which the asset belongs. Where a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identiÔ¨Åed, 
corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are 
allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent 
allocation basis can be identiÔ¨Åed.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing 
value in use, the estimated future cash Ô¨Çows are discounted to their present value using a 
discount rate that reÔ¨Çects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
speciÔ¨Åc to the asset for which the estimates of future cash Ô¨Çows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its 
carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in proÔ¨Åt or loss, unless the 
relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a 
revaluation decrease.Annual Report 2018 Annual Report 2018

3.13 Impairment of tangible assets (continued)
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-
generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that 
the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in 
prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in proÔ¨Åt or loss, unless the 
relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is 
treated as a revaluation increase.
3.14 Employee beneÔ¨Åts
3.14.1 Annual leave and leave passage
An accrual is made for the estimated liability for employees‚Äô entitlement to annual leave and leave 
passage as a result of services rendered by eligible employees up to the end of the year.  
3.14.2 Provision for employees‚Äô end of service indemnity
Provision is also made for the full amount of end of service indemnity due to non-UAE national 
employees in accordance with the UAE Labour Law and is based on current remuneration 
and their period of service at the end of the reporting period. Provisions for employees‚Äô end of 
service beneÔ¨Åt due to employees working with entities domiciled in other countries are made in 
accordance with local laws and regulations applicable.
The accrual relating to annual leave and leave passage is disclosed as a current liability, while the 
provision relating to end of service beneÔ¨Åt is disclosed as a non-current liability.
3.15 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a 
result of a past event, and is probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and 
a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to 
settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and 
uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash Ô¨Çows 
estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash 
Ô¨Çows, (where the eÔ¨Äect of time value of money is material).
When some or all of the economic beneÔ¨Åts required to settle a provision are expected to be 
recovered from a third party, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that 
reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.Notes to the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements for the year ended 31

3.16 Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying 
assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their 
intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time when the assets are ready 
for their intended use or sale. 
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of speciÔ¨Åc borrowings pending their 
expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the proÔ¨Åt or loss in the year in which they are incurred.
3.17  Financial instruments 
Policy applicable from 1 January 2018
Financial assets and Ô¨Ånancial liabilities are recognised in the Group‚Äôs consolidated statements 
of Ô¨Ånancial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instruments. 
Financial assets and Ô¨Ånancial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs 
that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of Ô¨Ånancial assets and Ô¨Ånancial liabilities 
are added to or deducted from the fair value of the Ô¨Ånancial assets or Ô¨Ånancial liabilities, as 
appropriate, on initial recognition.  Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of 
Ô¨Ånancial assets or Ô¨Ånancial liabilities held for trading are recognised immediately in proÔ¨Åt or loss. 
3.18 Financial assets
3.18.1 Upon adoption of IFRS 9  ‚Äì applicable from 1 January 2018
All regular way purchases or sales of Ô¨Ånancial assets are recognised and derecognised on a 
trade date basis. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of Ô¨Ånancial assets that 
require delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the 
marketplace. 
All recognised Ô¨Ånancial assets are measured subsequently in their entirety at either amortised 
cost or fair value, depending on the classiÔ¨Åcation of the Ô¨Ånancial assets.

3.18 Financial assets (continued)
(i) Debt instruments designated at amortised cost
Amortised cost and eÔ¨Äective interest rate method
The amortised cost of a Ô¨Ånancial asset is the amount at which the Ô¨Ånancial asset is measured at 
initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus the cumulative amortisation using the 
eÔ¨Äective interest method of any diÔ¨Äerence between that initial amount and the maturity amount, 
adjusted for any loss allowance. 
The eÔ¨Äective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument 
and of allocating interest income over the relevant period.
(ii) Financial assets at FVTOCI
On initial recognition, the Group may make an irrevocable election (on an 
instrument-by -instrument basis) to designate investments in equity instruments as at FVTOCI. 
Designation at FVTOCI is not permitted if the equity investment is held for trading or if it is 
contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination. 
A Ô¨Ånancial asset is held for trading if:

eÔ¨Äective hedging instrument).
Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are initially measured at fair value plus transaction 
costs. Subsequently, they are measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes 
in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the investments 
revaluation reserve. The cumulative gain or loss is not be reclassiÔ¨Åed to proÔ¨Åt or loss on disposal 
of the equity investments, instead, it is transferred to retained earnings.
Impairment of Ô¨Ånancial assets
The Group always recognises lifetime ECL for trade and receivables, due from related parties and 
cash and bank balances. The expected credit losses on these Ô¨Ånancial assets are estimated using 
a provision matrix based on the Group‚Äôs historical credit loss experience, adjusted for factors 
that are speciÔ¨Åc to the debtors, general economic conditions and an assessment of both the 
current as well as the forecast direction of conditions at the reporting date, including time value 
of money where appropriate.
Lifetime ECL represents the expected credit losses that will result from all possible default events 
over the expected life of a Ô¨Ånancial instrument.Notes to the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements for the year ended 31

Impairment of Ô¨Ånancial assets (continued)
(i) SigniÔ¨Åcant increase in credit risk
In assessing whether the credit risk on a Ô¨Ånancial instrument has increased signiÔ¨Åcantly since 
initial recognition, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the Ô¨Ånancial instrument 
at the reporting date with the risk of a default occurring on the Ô¨Ånancial instrument at the date 
of initial recognition. In making this assessment, the Group considers both quantitative and 
qualitative information that is reasonable and supportable, including historical experience and 
forward-looking information that is available without undue cost or eÔ¨Äort. Forward-looking 
information considered includes the future prospects of the industries in which the Group‚Äôs 
debtors operate, obtained from economic expert reports, Ô¨Ånancial analysts, governmental 
bodies, relevant think -tanks and other similar organisations, as well as consideration of various 
external sources of actual and forecast economic information that relate to the Group‚Äôs core 
operations.
In particular, the following information is taken into account when assessing whether credit risk 
has increased signiÔ¨Åcantly since initial recognition:
≈îBOBDUVBMPSFYQFDUFETJHOJ≈£DBOUEFUFSJPSBUJPOJOUIF≈£OBODJBMJOTUSVNFOU≈çTFYUFSOBM	JGBWBJMBCMF

instrument, e.g. a signiÔ¨Åcant increase in the credit spread, the credit default swap prices for the 
debtor, or the length of time or the extent to which the fair value of a Ô¨Ånancial asset has been less 
than its amortised cost;

environment of the debtor that results in a signiÔ¨Åcant decrease in the debtor‚Äôs ability to meet its 
debt obligations.
Irrespective of the outcome of the above assessment, the Group presumes that the credit risk on 
a Ô¨Ånancial asset has increased signiÔ¨Åcantly since initial recognition when contractual payments 
are more than 90 days past due, unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information 
that demonstrates otherwise.
For Ô¨Ånancial guarantee contracts, the date that the Group becomes a party to the irrevocable 
commitment is considered to be the date of initial recognition for the purposes of assessing the 
Ô¨Ånancial instrument for impairment. In assessing whether there has been a signiÔ¨Åcant increase in 
the credit risk since initial recognition of a Ô¨Ånancial guarantee contracts, the Group considers the 
changes in the risk that the speciÔ¨Åed debtor will default on the contract.
The Group regularly monitors the eÔ¨Äectiveness of the criteria used to identify whether there has 
been a signiÔ¨Åcant increase in credit risk and revises them as appropriate to ensure that the criteria 
are capable of identifying signiÔ¨Åcant increase in credit risk before the amount becomes past due.Annual Report 2018 Annual Report 2018

(ii) DeÔ¨Ånition of default
The Group considers an event of default if the debtor is unlikely to pay its credit obligation in full, 
without recourse by the Group to actions such as realizing security (if held).
Irrespective of the above analysis, the Group considers that default has occurred when a 
Ô¨Ånancial asset is more than 90 days past due unless the Group has reasonable and supportable 
information to demonstrate that a more lagging default criterion is more appropriate.
 (iii) Credit-impaired Ô¨Ånancial assets
A Ô¨Ånancial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on 
the estimated future cash Ô¨Çows of that Ô¨Ånancial asset have occurred. Evidence that a Ô¨Ånancial 
asset is credit-impaired includes observable data about the following events:

Ô¨Ånancial diÔ¨Éculties.
(iv) Write-oÔ¨Ä policy
The Group writes oÔ¨Ä a Ô¨Ånancial asset when there is information indicating that the debtor is in 
severe Ô¨Ånancial diÔ¨Éculty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery, e.g. when the debtor 
has been placed under liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy proceedings, or in the case 
of trade receivables, when the amounts are over two years past due, whichever occurs sooner. 
Financial assets written oÔ¨Ä may still be subject to enforcement activities under the Group‚Äôs 
recovery procedures, taking into account legal advice where appropriate. Any recoveries made 
are recognised in proÔ¨Åt or loss. 
(v) Measurement and recognition of expected credit losses
The measurement of expected credit losses is a function of the probability of default, loss 
given default (i.e. the magnitude of the loss if there is a default) and the exposure at default. The 
assessment of the probability of default and loss given default is based on historical data adjusted 
by forward-looking information as described above.  The expected credit loss is estimated as 
the diÔ¨Äerence between all contractual cash Ô¨Çows that are due to the Group in accordance with 
the contract and all the cash Ô¨Çows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at the original 
eÔ¨Äective interest rate
The Group recognises an impairment gain or loss in proÔ¨Åt or loss for all Ô¨Ånancial instruments with 
a corresponding adjustment to their carrying amount through a loss allowance account.Notes to the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements for the year ended 31

3.18 Financial assets (continued)
Derecognition of Ô¨Ånancial assets
The Group derecognises a Ô¨Ånancial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash Ô¨Çows from 
the asset expire; or it transfers the Ô¨Ånancial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the 
risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises 
its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the 
Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred Ô¨Ånancial asset, the 
Group continues to recognise the Ô¨Ånancial asset.
3.18.2 Policy under IAS 39 ‚Äìapplicable before 1 January 2018
The Group has the following Ô¨Ånancial assets: cash and cash equivalents, trade and other 
receivables (excluding advances and prepayments), due from related parties and available-for-
sale investments. These Ô¨Ånancial assets are classiÔ¨Åed as ‚Äòcash and cash equivalents‚Äô , ‚Äòloans and 
receivables‚Äô and ‚Äòinvestments in securities classiÔ¨Åed as available-for-sale (AFS)‚Äô . The classiÔ¨Åcation 
depends on the nature and purpose of the Ô¨Ånancial asset and is determined at the time of initial 
recognition.
The eÔ¨Äective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a Ô¨Ånancial asset 
and of allocating interest income over the relevant period. The eÔ¨Äective interest rate is the rate 
that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the Ô¨Ånancial 
asset, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
3.18.2.1 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other short term 
highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject 
to an insigniÔ¨Åcant risk of change in value.
3.18.2.2 Loans and receivables
Trade and other receivables and due from related parties that have Ô¨Åxed or determinable 
payments that are not quoted in an active market are classiÔ¨Åed as ‚Äòloans and receivables‚Äô . Loans 
and receivables are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the eÔ¨Äective interest rate method less any impairment. Interest 
income is recognised by applying the eÔ¨Äective rate of interest, except for short term receivables 
or when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
3.18.2.3 Available for sale investments (AFS)
Listed shares held by the Group that are traded in an active market are classiÔ¨Åed as being AFS 
and are stated at fair value. The Group also has investments in unlisted shares that are not traded 
in an active market but are also classiÔ¨Åed as AFS Ô¨Ånancial assets and stated at cost because 
management considers that fair value cannot be reliably measured. Gains and losses arising 
from changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in 
the cumulative changes in fair valuation of investments with the exception of impairment losses, 
which are recognised in proÔ¨Åt or loss. Where the investment is disposed of or is determined to be 
impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in the cumulative changes in fair 
valuation is reclassiÔ¨Åed to proÔ¨Åt or loss.Annual Report 2018 Annual Report 2018

3.18.2.3   Available for sale investments (AFS) (continued)
Dividends on AFS investments are recognised in proÔ¨Åt or loss when the Group‚Äôs right to receive 
the dividends is established.
The fair value of AFS investments denominated in a foreign currency is determined in that foreign 
currency and translated at the spot rate at the reporting date. The change in fair value attributable 
to translation diÔ¨Äerences that result from a change in amortised cost of the asset is recognised in 
proÔ¨Åt or loss, and other changes are recognised in other comprehensive income.
3.18.2.4   Impairment of Ô¨Ånancial assets
Financial assets, are assessed for indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting period. 
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more 
events that occurred after the initial recognition of the Ô¨Ånancial asset, the estimated future cash 
Ô¨Çows of the asset have been aÔ¨Äected.
For listed and unlisted equity investments classiÔ¨Åed as AFS investments, a signiÔ¨Åcant or prolonged 
decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered to be objective evidence of 
impairment.
For all other Ô¨Ånancial assets, objective evidence of impairment could include:
≈îTJHOJ≈£DBOU≈£OBODJBMEJ≈•DVMUZPGUIFJTTVFSPSDPVOUFSQBSUZPS

For certain categories of Ô¨Ånancial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to 
be impaired individually are, in addition, assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective 
evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Group‚Äôs past experience 
of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the 
average credit period, as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions 
that correlate with default on receivables.
For Ô¨Ånancial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment is the diÔ¨Äerence 
between the asset‚Äôs carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash Ô¨Çows, 
discounted at the Ô¨Ånancial asset‚Äôs original eÔ¨Äective interest rate. For Ô¨Ånancial assets carried 
at cost, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the diÔ¨Äerence between the asset‚Äôs 
carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash Ô¨Çows discounted at the 
current market rate of return for a similar Ô¨Ånancial asset. Such impairment loss will not be 
reversed in subsequent periods.
The carrying amount of the Ô¨Ånancial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for 
all Ô¨Ånancial assets with the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is 
reduced through the use of an allowance account. When an account receivable is considered 
uncollectible, it is written oÔ¨Ä against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts 
previously written oÔ¨Ä are credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying 
amount of the allowance account are recognised in proÔ¨Åt or loss. 
When an AFS Ô¨Ånancial asset is considered to be impaired, cumulative gains or losses previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassiÔ¨Åed to proÔ¨Åt or loss in the period.Notes to the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements for the year ended 31

3.18.2.4 Impairment of Ô¨Ånancial assets (continued)
With the exception of AFS equity instruments, if, in a subsequent period, the amount of the 
impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring 
after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed 
through proÔ¨Åt or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the Ô¨Ånancial asset at the date 
the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the 
impairment not been recognised.
In respect of AFS equity securities, impairment losses previously recognised in proÔ¨Åt or loss are  
not reversed through proÔ¨Åt or loss. Any increase in fair value subsequent to an impairment loss is 
recognised in other comprehensive income.
3.18.2.5 Derecognition of Ô¨Ånancial assets
The Group derecognises a Ô¨Ånancial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash Ô¨Çows 
from the asset expire; or it transfers the Ô¨Ånancial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group 
recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have 
to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred 
Ô¨Ånancial asset, the Group continues to recognise the Ô¨Ånancial asset.
3.19 Financial liabilities and equity instruments 
3.19.1 Upon adoption of IFRS 9 ‚Äì applicable from 1 January 2018

4 Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
In the application of the Group‚Äôs accounting policies, which are described in Note 3, 
management is required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates 
and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are 
considered to be relevant. Actual results may diÔ¨Äer from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to 
accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision 
aÔ¨Äects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision aÔ¨Äects 
both current and future periods. The signiÔ¨Åcant judgements and estimates made by management 
that have a signiÔ¨Åcant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities within the next Ô¨Ånancial year are described below:
4.1 Critical judgements in applying accounting policies
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (see 4.2 below), 
that the management has made in the process of applying the Group‚Äôs accounting policies and 
that have the most signiÔ¨Åcant eÔ¨Äect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial 
statements.
4.1.1 Revenue recognition
4.1.1.1 applicable from 1 January 2018
Management considers recognising revenue over time, if one of the following criteria is met, 
otherwise revenue will be recognised at a point in time:
a) the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the beneÔ¨Åts provided by the Group‚Äôs 
performance as the Group performs;
b)  the Group‚Äôs performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset 
is created or enhanced; or
c)  the Group‚Äôs performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity and the 
entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.
As further described in note 3, revenue is measured based on the consideration to which the 
Group expects to be entitled in a contract with a customer and excludes amounts collected on 
behalf of third parties. The Group recognises revenue when it performs service to a customer. 
Revenue from construction is recognised over time on a costtocost method, i.e. based on the 
proportion of contract costs incurred for work performed to date relative to the estimated total 
contract costs. The Group consider that this input method is an appropriate measure of the 
progress towards complete satisfaction of these performance obligations under IFRS 15.
Management has considered the detailed criteria for the recognition of revenue from the sale 
of goods set out in IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers, and in particular whether 
the Group had transferred control of the goods to the customers.  Based on the acceptance by 
the customer of the liability for the goods sold, management is satisÔ¨Åed that control has been 
transferred upon acceptance of delivery and the recognition of the revenue is appropriate.Annual Report 2018 Annual Report 2018

4.1.1  Revenue recognition (continued)
4.1.1.1 applicable from 1 January 2018 (continued)
Contract variations are recognised as revenues only to the extent that it is probable that they will 
not result in a signiÔ¨Åcant reversal of revenue in subsequent periods. Management considers prior 
experience, application of contract terms and the relationship with the customers in making their 
judgement.
Contract claims are recognised as revenue only when management believes that only to the 
extent that it is probable that they will not result in a signiÔ¨Åcant reversal of revenue in subsequent 
periods. Management reviews the judgment related to these contract claims periodically and 
adjustments are made in the future periods, if assessments indicate that such adjustments are 
appropriate.
4.1.1.2 applicable before 1 January 2018
The Group uses the percentage-of-completion method in accounting for its ongoing 
contract services. Use of percentage-of-completion method requires the Group to estimate 
the proportion of work performed to date (based on the project managers‚Äô judgment) which 
management considers provides the most appropriate measures of percentage-of-completion.
When the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are 
recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity on the end of the 
reporting period.  In judging whether the outcome of the construction contract can be estimated 
reliably, management has considered the detailed criterion for determination of such outcome as 
set out in IAS 11 - Construction Contracts. For the purpose of estimating the stage of completion 
of contract activity, management has considered the contracted revenue and forecasted cost 
related to the construction contract.
Management has considered the detailed criteria for the recognition of revenue from the sale of 
goods set out in International Accounting Standard 18: Revenue, and in particular whether the 
Group had transferred risks and rewards of ownership of the goods. Based on the acceptance by 
the customer of the liability for the goods sold, management is satisÔ¨Åed that the signiÔ¨Åcant risks 
and rewards have been transferred and the recognition of the revenue is appropriate.Notes to the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements for the year ended 31

uncertainty (continued)
4.1 Critical judgements in applying accounting policies (continued)
4.1.2 ClassiÔ¨Åcation of properties
In the process of classifying properties, management has made various judgments. Judgments 
are needed to determine whether a property qualiÔ¨Åes as an investment property, property, 
plant and equipment, property under development and/or property held for sale. Management 
develops criteria so that it can exercise that judgment consistently in accordance with the 
deÔ¨Ånitions of investment property, property, plant and equipment, property under development 
and property held for sale. In making its judgment, management has considered the detailed 
criteria and related guidance set out in IAS 2 ‚Äì Inventories, IAS 16 ‚Äì Property, Plant and 
Equipment, and IAS 40 ‚Äì Investment Property, with regards to the intended use of the property.
4.1.3 Upon adoption of IFRS 9 ‚Äì applicable from 1 January 2018
4.1.3.1 Business Model Assessment 
ClassiÔ¨Åcation and measurement of Ô¨Ånancial assets depends on the results of the SPPI and the 
business model test. The Group determines the business model at a level that reÔ¨Çects how 
groups of Ô¨Ånancial assets are managed together to achieve a particular business objective. This 
assessment includes judgement reÔ¨Çecting all relevant evidence including how the performance 
of the assets is evaluated and their performance measured, the risks that aÔ¨Äect the performance 
of the assets and how these are managed and how the managers of the assets are compensated. 
The Group monitors Ô¨Ånancial assets measured at amortised cost or fair value through other 
comprehensive income that are derecognised prior to their maturity to understand the reason for 
their disposal and whether the reasons are consistent with the objective of the business for which 
the asset was held. Monitoring is part of the Group‚Äôs continuous assessment of whether the 
business model for which the remaining Ô¨Ånancial assets are held continues to be appropriate and 
if it is not appropriate whether there has been a change in business model and so a prospective 
change to the classiÔ¨Åcation of those assets. No such changes were required during the periods 
presented.
4.1.3.2 SigniÔ¨Åcant increase in credit risk
ECL are measured as an allowance equal to 12-month ECL for stage 1 assets, or lifetime ECL 
assets for stage 2 or stage 3 assets. An asset moves to stage 2 when its credit risk has increased 
signiÔ¨Åcantly since initial recognition. IFRS 9 does not deÔ¨Åne what constitutes a signiÔ¨Åcant 
increase in credit risk. In assessing whether the credit risk of an asset has signiÔ¨Åcantly increased 
the Group takes into account qualitative and quantitative reasonable and supportable forward 
looking information. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reÔ¨Çect current and forward-looking 
information on macroeconomic factors aÔ¨Äecting the ability of the customers to settle the 
receivables. 
4.1.4 Financial instruments under IAS 39, applicable before 1 January 2018
4.1.4.1  ClassiÔ¨Åcation of investment in securities 
Management designates at the time of acquisition of securities whether these should be classiÔ¨Åed 
as at available-for-sale (AFS), held for trading or amortised cost. In judging whether investments 
in securities are as at AFS, held for trading or amortised cost, Management has considered 
the detailed criteria for determination of such classiÔ¨Åcation as set out in IAS 39 ‚ÄúFinancial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement‚Äù . Management is satisÔ¨Åed that its investments in 
securities are appropriately classiÔ¨Åed. Annual Report 2018 Annual Report 2018

4 Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)
4.2 Key sources of estimation uncertainty
 
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at 
the end of the reporting period, that have a signiÔ¨Åcant risk of causing a material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next Ô¨Ånancial year, are discussed below:
4.2.1 Calculation of loss allowance
When measuring ECL the Group uses reasonable and supportable forward looking information, 
which is based on assumptions for the future movement of diÔ¨Äerent economic drivers and 
how these drivers will aÔ¨Äect each other.  Loss given default is an estimate of the loss arising on 
default. It is based on the diÔ¨Äerence between the contractual cash Ô¨Çows due and those that the 
lender would expect to receive, taking into account cash Ô¨Çows from collateral and integral credit 
enhancements.  Management is satisÔ¨Åed that no additional impairment is required on its trade 
receivables, contract assets from customers and other receivables in excess of amount already 
provided.
4.2.2 Allowance for slow moving inventories  
Raw materials are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Adjustments to reduce 
the cost of inventory to its net realisable value, if required, are made at the product level for 
estimated excess, obsolescence or impaired balances. Factors inÔ¨Çuencing these adjustments 
include changes in demand, technological changes, physical deterioration and quality issues. 
Revisions to the allowance for slow moving inventories would be required if the outcome of 
these indicative factors diÔ¨Äer from the estimates. 
4.2.3 Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and investment properties
The Group determines the estimated useful lives of its property, plant and equipment and 
investment properties for calculating depreciation. This estimate is determined after considering 
the expected usage of the asset or physical wear and tear. Management reviews the residual 
value and useful lives annually and the future depreciation or amortisation charge would be 
adjusted where management believes that the useful lives diÔ¨Äer from current estimates.
4.2.4 Valuation of unquoted equity investments
4.2.4.1 applicable from 1 January 2018
Valuation of unquoted AFS equity investments is normally based market observable data to the 
extent practicable.  When level 1 inputs are not available the Group determines fair value based 
another instrument that is substantially the same, expected cash Ô¨Çows discounted at current 
rates for similar instruments or other valuation models. Management believes that the carrying 
values of these unquoted equity investments are appropriately measured at their fair values. Notes to the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements for the year ended 31 
December 2018 (continued)
4   Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation 
uncertainty (continued)
4.2   Key sources of estimation uncertainty  (continued)
4.2.4   Valuation of unquoted equity investments (continued)
4.2.4.1   applicable before 1 January 2018
Valuation of unquoted AFS equity investments is normally based on recent market transactions 
on an arm‚Äôs length basis, fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, expected 
cash Ô¨Çows discounted at current rates for similar instruments or other valuation models.  In 
the absence of an active market for these investments or any recent transactions that could 
provide evidence of the current fair value, these investments are carried at cost less recognised 
impairment losses, if any. Management believes that the carrying values of these unquoted equity 
investments are not materially diÔ¨Äerent from their fair values.
4.2.5   Impairment of investment in associates and joint ventures
Management regularly reviews its investment in associates and joint ventures for indicators of 
impairment. This determination of whether investment associates and joint ventures are impaired 
entails management‚Äôs evaluation of the speciÔ¨Åc investee‚Äôs proÔ¨Åtability, liquidity, solvency and 
ability to generate operating cash Ô¨Çows from the date of acquisition and until the foreseeable 
future.  The diÔ¨Äerence between the estimated recoverable amount and the carrying value 
of investment is recognised as an expense in proÔ¨Åt or loss. Management is satisÔ¨Åed that no 
impairment provision is necessary on its investment in associates and joint ventures.Annual Report 2018 Annual Report 2018Notes to the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 (continued)

The fair value of investment property was determined by using discounted cash Ô¨Çow model 
prepared internally by the management as of 31 December 2018. The fair value of the investment 
property is not lower than the carrying value. The fair value of the investment property as at 31 
December 2018 is estimated to be around AED 30 million (2017: AED 27 million). Assumption 
used by the management are constant historic cash Ô¨Çows and discount rate of 10% per annum. 
For disclosure purpose these investment properties are being considered as level 3.Annual Report 2018 Annual Report 2018

to AED/uni00A0177 million (2017: AED 200 million) and was determined by an independent appraiser 
using the market comparable approach that reÔ¨Çects recent transactions prices for similar 
properties. In estimating the fair value of the properties, the highest and best use of the properties 
was determined to be their current use. For disclosure purposes, these properties are being 
considered as Level 3. There were no transfers between the levels during the year.

by the management using the future cash Ô¨Çows and discount rate of 7% per annum, which was 
based on historical pattern and general standards in the industry.

loss experience and an analysis of the debtor‚Äôs current Ô¨Ånancial position, adjusted for factors 
that are speciÔ¨Åc to the debtors, general economic conditions of the industry in which the debtor 
operates and an assessment of both the current as well as the forecast direction of conditions at 
the reporting date, including time value of money where appropriate.

32.4 Financial risk management objectives
The management of the Group monitors and manages the Ô¨Ånancial risks relating to the 
operations of the Group through internal risk reports which analyse exposures by degree and 
magnitude of risks. These risks include market risk (including currency risk, fair value interest rate 
risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.Notes to the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements for the year ended 31 
December 2018 (continued)

32.4 Financial risk management objectives (continued)
32.4.1 Market risk
The Group‚Äôs activities expose it primarily to the Ô¨Ånancial risks of changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates and interest rates.
Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis. 
There has been no change to the Group‚Äôs exposure to market risks or the manner in which it 
manages and measures the risk.
 
32.4.1.1 Foreign currency risk 
The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Hence, exposures 
to exchange rate Ô¨Çuctuations arise. There are no signiÔ¨Åcant exchange rate risks for Ô¨Ånancial 
assets and liabilities that are denominated in Arab Emirates Dirhams, other GCC currencies, EUR 
and US Dollars to which the Dirham is Ô¨Åxed.  
32.4.1.2 Interest rate risk 
The Group‚Äôs exposure to interest rate risk relates to its deposits and bank borrowings. At 31 
December 2018, deposits carried an interest rate of 0.25% to 3.15% per annum (31 December 
2017: 0.25% to 3.15% per annum) and the bank borrowings carried at an interest rate of 3 months 
EIBOR + 3% per annum (31/uni00A0December 2017: 3 months EIBOR + 3% per annum).
32.4.1.2.1 Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for 
interest-bearing Ô¨Ånancial assets and Ô¨Ånancial liabilities assuming the amount of Ô¨Ånancial assets 
and Ô¨Ånancial liabilities at the end of the reporting period were outstanding for the whole year. 
If interest rates had been 50 basis points higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, 
the Group‚Äôs proÔ¨Åt for the year ended 31 December 2018 would increase/decrease by AED/uni00A01.5 
million (2017: AED/uni00A01.5 million).  
For borrowings, if interest rates had been at the minimum or maximum EIBOR rate and all other 
variables were held constant, the Group‚Äôs capitalised borrowing costs for the year ended 31 
December 2018 would decrease/increase by AED/uni00A00.3 million (2017: nil).
32.4.1.3 Equity price risk
32.4.1.3.1 Sensitivity analysis
At the reporting date if the prices of investments in equity instruments are 10% higher/lower as 
per the assumptions mentioned below and all the other variables were held constant the Group‚Äôs: 
Equity would have increased/decreased by AED/uni00A02.3 million (2017: AED 1 million) in the case of 
Ô¨Ånancial assets at FVTOCI.Annual Report 2018 Annual Report 2018

32.4.1 Market risk (continued)
32.4.1.3 Equity price risk (continued)
32.4.1.3.2 Method and assumptions for sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analysis has been done based on the exposure to equity price risk as at the reporting 
date.
As at the reporting date, if the prices of investments in equity instruments are 10% higher/ lower on 
the market value uniformly for all equities while all other variables are held constant, the impact on 
proÔ¨Åt or loss and equity has been shown above.
A 10% change in the prices of investments in equity instruments has been used to give a realistic 
assessment as a plausible event.
32.4.2 Credit risk 
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counter party will default on its contractual obligations resulting 
in Ô¨Ånancial loss to the Group. The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy 
counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk of Ô¨Ånancial loss from defaults. 
Further, the Group always measures the loss allowance for trade receivables at an amount equal 
to lifetime ECL using the simpliÔ¨Åed approach. The expected credit losses on trade receivables 
are estimated using a provision matrix by reference to past default experience of the debtor 
and an analysis of the debtor‚Äôs current Ô¨Ånancial position, adjusted for factors that are speciÔ¨Åc to 
the debtors, general economic conditions of the industry in which the debtors operate and an 
assessment of both the current as well as the forecast direction of conditions at the reporting 
date. 
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-
ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The carrying amount of Ô¨Ånancial assets recorded in the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements, which is 
net of impairment losses, represents the Group‚Äôs maximum exposure to credit risk.
32.4.3 Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk refers to the risk that an entity will encounter diÔ¨Éculty in meeting obligations 
associated with its Ô¨Ånancial liabilities at maturity date.
The Group manages the liquidity risk through risk management framework for the Group‚Äôs 
short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements by maintaining 
adequate reserves, suÔ¨Écient cash and cash equivalent and the availability of Ô¨Ånancing through 
banking arrangements to ensure funds are available to meet its commitments for liabilities as 
they fall due.Notes to the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements for the year ended 31

The table below summarises the maturity proÔ¨Åle of the Group‚Äôs Ô¨Ånancial instruments. The 
contractual maturities of the Ô¨Ånancial instruments have been determined on the basis of the 
remaining period at the reporting date to the contractual maturity date. The maturity proÔ¨Åle is 
monitored by Management to ensure adequate liquidity is maintained. The maturity proÔ¨Åle of 
the Ô¨Ånancial assets and Ô¨Ånancial liabilities at the reporting date based on contractual repayment
